# Ankiapp decks collaboration

This repo is a just a convinient place where to collaborate on shared [AnkiApp](https://ankiapp.com) decks.

## Add a new deck

Create a directory named `deck-TITLE` (replace `TITLE` with the title of the new deck). Every deck folder must contain a `.csv` file containing the cards and the layout folder.

The `.csv` files must contains at least two columns (`back` and `front`).

**Suggested**: you can create a new deck from [web.ankiapp.com](https://web.ankiapp.com) and export it from [nexus.ankiapp.com](https://nexus.ankiapp.com).

## Edit a deck

Modify the `.csv` file of the deck:

  - with a text editor
  - with Excel or similar
  - **Suggested**: import the deck in ankiapp from [nexus.ankiapp.com](https://nexus.ankiapp.com) and edit it using the web editor [web.ankiapp.com](https://web.ankiapp.com). Once you are done, export the deck replacing the current one.

Commit or PR when you are done.
